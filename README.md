C Primer Plus, Sixth Edition.

This is my firsts attempts of solving tasks menioned at C Primer Plus, sixth edition book. It includes answers for all the exercises.

I'm just a student, and sure not an expert, so if you managed to compile and run any of these source-files it doesn't mean I found the correct answer) So your bug reports or pull requests are highly apperciated.

These solutions are not optimal both in terms of memory and processor resources, but I hope I will be refactor it when become more skillful.


###Organization

Each dir contains only the code from the specific chapter.

My code is indented GNU style.

###Compiling

I propose to use the c99 standard when compiling: -std=c99 for all the files.
