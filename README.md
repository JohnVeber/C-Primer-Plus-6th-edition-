# C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition).

This is my firsts attempts of solving tasks menioned at C Primer Plus, sixth edition book. This repo includes solutions for all mentioned exercises.

I'm just a student, and sure not an expert, so if you managed to compile and run any of these source-files it doesn't mean I found the correct answer.
That's why your bug reports or pull requests are highly apperciated.

These solutions are not optimal both in terms of memory and processor resources, but I hope I will be refactor it when become more skillful.


## Organization

1. Each dir named "CHAPTER" contains only code from the specific chapter.
2. Inside them you can find "Listings" folder which contains only interesting examples of author's code I decidet to test.
3. You can also find "Questions" folder inside some of "Chapters" folders. I put inside a code of all of questions which paid my attention more than others.
4. Finally you can find "Excercises" folders and fules named "Chapter_x_bugs.txt". 
5. File with bugs contain all of questions I couldn't solve during a short period of time and should return to them later.
6. My code is indented GNU style.

## Compiling

I propose to use the c99 standard when compiling: -std=c99 for all the files.
