This repo contains my first attempts of C language programming task's solving.
You can find here listings and tasks from programming books listed below:

1. Steven Prata. C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition).
2. TBD

I'm just a student, and sure not an expert, so if you managed to compile and run any of these source-files it doesn't mean I found the correct answer.
That's why your bug reports or pull requests are highly apperciated.

These solutions are not optimal both in terms of memory and processor resources, but I hope I will be refactor it when become more skillful.


## Organization

1. Each dir named "CHAPTER_â„–" contains only code from the specific chapter of particular book.
2. You can find "LISTINGS" folder inside, which contains interesting examples of author's code I decided to test.
3. You can also find "Questions" folder inside some of "Chapters" folders. I putted inside a code of some questions which paid my attention more than others.
4. Finally you can find "Excercises" folders and files named as "Chapter_x_bugs.txt" which sence I think should be clear. 
5. File with bugs contain all of questions I couldn't solve during a short period of time and should return to them later.
6. This code is indented GNU style.

## Compiling

I propose to use the c17 standard when compiling: -std=c17 for all the files.
